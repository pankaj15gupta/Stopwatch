<h1> Stop watch</h1>
The Stopwatch project was created using only vanilla Javascript with no libraries or frameworks.

The timer will start after the click event happens and keep running until it stops.

We can also stop the timer after clicking the stop button.

I tried to keep the start and stop buttons on one button.

The start button will turn to stop after a click event happens

It helps us give a more accurate time because we don't have to click another button; the same button helps us stop the timer.

The reset button will reset the timer to 0, and we will start the timer again for different calculations.
